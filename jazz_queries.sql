/*
For my first query I wanted to identify jazz standards in the dataset where the harmonic progression deviates 
from the typical 4-bar multiples in Western music. I used a simple query to retrieve the song ID, title, year, and the count of bars 
in the harmonic progression for each non-conforming song.

/*
Crafted a join query to identify the top 10 instrumental-only songs frequently played at jam sessions. 
Retrieved relevant details such as song title, key signature, style, number of calls, 
and the title of the song it is a contrafact of (if applicable).

/*
This set of SQL queries aims to identify prolific composers within the datasetâ€”individuals who have written the music for more than 5 songs 
but have not contributed to the lyrics. 
The results include the unique identifier (ID), formatted name in the Last, First format (e.g., Parker, Charlie), 
and, where applicable, the age at death. 
The latter will be left blank for composers who are still alive. 
These queries shed light on notable individuals who have made significant contributions to music as composers without delving into lyricism.

In exploring the rich cultural heritage of jazz often referred to as "African-American classical music," 
the following subquery delves into summary statistics for songs crafted by Black artists. 
The analysis encompasses the total number of songs where any of the writers were Black, 
along with key metrics such as the highest, average (rounded to 0 decimals), 
and lowest ranking among these songs. To ensure accuracy, 
each song is counted only once in these statistics, acknowledging the collaborative nature of music creation.
